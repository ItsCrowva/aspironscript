-- Aspscript
# Heya! This is the Aspiron Script Example code.
# What this does is it will go through a bunch of different aspects of the Asiron Script Language.
# This will grow over time and also include some concept parts.
# Lets go through the code.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#        Minescript - This is to turn code into data packs
#
#      This follows Minescript 2.0 This won't work with the
#              included backward compat conversion
#
#   Some limitations:
#     - Please refrain from using multiple of the same file name
#     - You'll need to delete a space between the first and last { } upon file generation
#     - You can not tag/comment mid line. Have all comments on the line after
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This initialises the script. This adds instructures for setup in the instruction part
#
# at the very bottom of the log file.
# This also eventually will be used to help the converter build the data pack for you

Define Function:
  Test
  InFile[
